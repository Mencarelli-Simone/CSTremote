The idea of this project is to use the cst python package
to try and controll the execution, optimization, etc of a project

test1.py downloads the data from a project, changes a parameter and launches a simulation

mycom.py reimplements the invoke method of matlab for com calls.
test2.py rewrites test1.py with these simplified functions.
